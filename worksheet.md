Name(s) and Login(s):



1. Dennis Ritchie, the creator of the C programming language,
was born on September 9th, 1941.  If he were still alive,
how old would he be today?  Find out by running the `birthday`
program on the appropriate inputs and enter your solution here.

ans:
Today is 2023/10/05
Your birthday was 1841/09/09
Hello, Dennis.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today


2. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of the C++ programming
language, the object-oriented extension of C, was born on
December 30th, 1950.  How old is he today?
ans:
Today is 2023/10/05
Your birthday was 1950/12/30
Hello, Bjarne.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today




3. Software testing often involves testing code with known
"bad" input in an attempt to break it (sometimes this is
referred to as *fuzzing*).  Try breaking the `birthday_cli`
program by giving it "bad" input and observe the consequences.
Give at least two examples of potentially bad input and the
results you observe.
Ans: 
Example 1:Bad input: M azan 1900 4 
Result:Today is 2023/10/11
Your birthday was 
Hello, M azan.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today.
Example 2:Bad input:99 / 0m 12
result:Today is 2023/10/11
Your birthday was 
Hello, 99.  You are 0 years, 0 weeks, and 0 days old today.



4. Complete all the size and range entries below.

* `char`
  size: 1 byte
  range: -128 to 127
* `short int`
  size:2 byte
  range:-32768 to 32767
* `int`
  size: 4 bytes.
  range: -2147483648 to 2147483647
* `long int`
  size: 4 bytes
  range:-2147483648 to  2147483647
* `float`
  size: 4 bytes.
  range: 7 digits of accuracy
* `double`
  size: 8 bytes.
  range: 15 digits of accuracy


5. Use your working currency conversion to determine
the exchange amounts for the following inputs:

  a) $250.25
  Answer:
  Half of the Dollor exchange to 88.9639 GBP
  Half of the Dollar exchange to 14374 JPY

  b) $1,000.52
  Answer:
  Half of the Dollor exchange to 355.5 GBP
  Half of the Dollar exchange to 57442 JPY

  c) $968,410.12
   Answer:
  Half of the Dollor exchange to 344270 GBP
  Half of the Dollar exchange to 55627898 JPY
  




6. Suppose that you had used only `int` types
in your conversion program.  Would you be able
to use it to convert the US national debt
(which as of 2020 was \$26,009,754,625,487)?
Why or why not?
Answer: NO because integer can stored the number upto 32 bit and the given number greater so 32bit not sufficient for that .




7. Mixed types

a) Run the `area` program with 3 and 4 as inputs.  
What value do you get?  Is this result correct?
Answer:
Value:The area is 0.000000 square units.
Not giving the correct answer use formula incorrectly because the precedance level of / and same.



b) Execute the program again with inputs 3 and 5.
Does the program give correct results?  Why not?
Answer:still wrong answer.



c) Fix the program by editing the `area.c` source
code so that the program produces correct results.
Answer:
The area is 8.000000 square units.
I increased the precedance level of base*traingle by include parenthesis and then divide them by 2 like that (base*height)/2.
